# Debezium Incubator

Debezium is an open source project that provides a low latency data streaming platform for change data capture (CDC).

_Note, Mar. 2021: The Debezium project has moved away from the model of a shared incubator repo; instead there'are dedicated repos for each incubating and/or community-led connector._

This repository is being retained and archived for historical, read-only purposes.

If you're looking for a connector that was once part of this repository, below are links to where they've been relocated:

* [Cassandra](https://github.com/debezium/debezium-connector-cassandra)
* [Db2](https://github.com/debezium/debezium-connector-db2)
* [Oracle](https://github.com/debezium/debezium)
